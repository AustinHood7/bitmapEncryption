# bitmapEncryption
This was a project that takes a bitmap file and can either encrypt or decrypt any messages that are in the bitmap file. OOP methodologies were heavily used in this program and it was the largest school project I have had as of december 2021. Many files were used as well as using basic stenography data that was found using web research.
